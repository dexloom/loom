## What is Loom?

Loom is a modular framework designed to streamline the development of automated strategies for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other blockchain applications.

## Who is Loom for?

First of all, Loom will not generate any revenue and is challenging for newcomers. The Loom framework is tailored for advanced users with prior experience in blockchain development. Itâ€™s specifically designed for developers building trading bots, arbitrage bots, block builders, solvers, or those looking to work with blockchain events.

## How to get started?

See the [Getting started](https://dexloom.github.io/loom/getting_started.html) guide. Have also a look at the [Multicaller](https://github.com/dexloom/multicaller) smart contract repository.
